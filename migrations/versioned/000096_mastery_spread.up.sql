-- Migration 000096: neighbour-spread credit for the knowledge-guidance overlay.
--
-- Reading one page credits the pages adjacent to it with a fraction of the
-- reader's time, so a node the person has not opened yet still picks up a little
-- context from the pages around it. Only *reading time* spreads: a view that
-- merely registered a count (a few seconds of glancing) turns into a few seconds
-- of credit, i.e. nothing at scoring time.
--
-- One row per (subject, kb, slug, day). spread_seconds stores the source page's
-- reading seconds undiscounted; the discount factor and the cap are scoring
-- constants (mastery.Config), applied when the water level is computed, so they
-- can be retuned without rewriting history.
